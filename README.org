#+title: Issues


There are some issues and bad practices that are made deliberately to save time; mostly need
to be fixed in the future:

+ Global issues:
  + All the build scripts automatically use latest image build.
  + There is no versioning for images.
  + Error handling seems weak.
  + Concurrent coding is needed.
  + There is no authorization, authentication only.

* Database Issues:
+ Current design is down in the simplest possible way, which might not be best performant.
  consider redesign some of the databases schemata
+ Database credentials does not exist in the current version; a global password is used
  between all databases to ease development.
* Dependancy Tree

#+title: Issues


There are some issues and bad practices that are made deliberately to save time; mostly need
to be fixed in the future:

+ Global issues:
  + All the build scripts automatically use latest image build.
  + There is no versioning for images.

* Database Issues:
+ Current design is down in the simplest possible way, which might not be best performant.
  consider redesign some of the databases schemata

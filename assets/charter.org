* Project Metadata
+ Project Name: Debate System
+ Project Description: A polymathic, multi-feature services that consolidate the structure
  of online conversations. Includes a web-client implementation.
+ Data Approved: 03 Nov, 2022.
* Businesses Case
+ Current situation of debate platforms:
  + Either too minimal and not unusable (like most image board websites), or;
  + Too bloated and badly designed, and leak substantial features (like Kialo).
+ Our objectives are to fulfill the both shortcomings with a platform that is compatible
  with multi-typed midea structures.

* Risk and Constrains
+ In the case of the implementation of external platforms support, that might cause either
  complexities in performance, or constrains from those platforms (some platforms might
  disable the content out of their domain)
* Expected Goals
We are anticipating having a semi-complete platform with an appropriate user interface, that
fulfills the mentioned shortcomings.
* Scope Description
- In Scope:
  + Interactive debate management that supports interactive arguing.
  + Quoting, arguing and response support.
- Out of scope:
  + Chat support.
  + External platforms conversations support.
